# quiz-app


A replacement for Odin Tic-Tac-Toe game project. Main goals of that project is to:
- Continue learning about JS objects
- Using factory functions as a replacement for constructor functions
- Encapsulation via the module pattern (IIFE)
- Decoupling internal game logic from the display (DOM)

I aim to create this quiz app while following the same learning objectives.
